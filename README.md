## Data Format:
at the main forlder (where manage.py exists), there should be a folder named 'data_year'. in this directory there should exist csv files by these names:

drivers/
farmers&hills/
stations

the first row is the header of each coloumn:

Station: Name

driver: Name, Locatoin

farmers&hills: Name, Size

Inside data_year a folder with name 'schedule' exists. For each station, there exist two csv files: 'station name_hills', 'station name_drivers'. The format is the same as previous.
